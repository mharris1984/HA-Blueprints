# HA-Blueprints

Personal Blueprints I've created to make my life easier with HA automations.  Feel free to Grab any to work for you!  

<p>Here is a list of Blueprints that I have thrown together.  You can open up each in the YAML files in the tree, or click the add Blueprint button to auto apply to your HomeAssistant Installation. <br>
Let me know if you have any questions or comments. </p>
